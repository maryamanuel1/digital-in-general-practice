Digital Health Insights
What can the 2021 GP Patient Survey tell us about access to online general practice services?
6th August 2021 | Mary Amanuel & Craig Shenton (NHSX Analytics Unit)

Non-urgent advice: Key findings
Remote appointments are now as common as face-to-face appointments. While most patients are comfortable with online appointments, many would still prefer face-to-face appointments in the future.
Almost half (44%) of patients have used an online GP service in the last 12 months. Patients will long term health conditions are more likely than average to use online services.
Patients aged 75 and over are the least likely to use online GP services over all, with more that two thirds (68%) not using any online service in the last 12 months.
In terms of web accessability, patients are finding it more difficult to use their GP practice website, particularly for those aged 75 and over.

Introduction
As more people use digital tools and websites to manage their physical (37%) and mental health (25%) in 2021 [1], access to quality online health services is more important now than ever. Given that 89% of consumers use digital tools for online banking and 60% for accessing local council information [1], there is great potential to expand digital health services in the UK.

Our analysis builds on the GP Patient Survey 2021 — a national survey of patients’ experiences of general practice — to shed light on the use of, and barriers to, accessing online general practice services in England since the coronavirus pandemic [2].

Appointments
Key finding:
Remote appointments are now as common as in person appointments
For the first time, more remote appointments took place in April 2020 than face-to-face appointments [3]. In previous surveys, face-to-face appointments were the dominant appointment type, making up 90% of the patient appointments. In 2021, however, 50% of patients reported having a remote appointment (compared with 10% in 2020) [3].

How do patients feel about remote appointments?
Patients are more likely to say their needs were met in their last face-to-face appointment (95%) than in their last remote appointment (92%) [2].

Research from the Office for National Statistics found that, in August 2020, 64% of people said they would be ‘comfortable’ or ‘very comfortable’ attending an online appointment with a health professional [4]. However, so over 70 (53%) or with an underlying health condition (57%) weren’t as comfortable with online appointments [5].

Online Services
Key finding:
Almost half (44%) of patients have used an online GP service in the last 12 months
Ordering repeat prescriptions was the most popular activity among those who used an online service (26%), followed by booking an appointment online (19%). Yet, online GP services haven't fully taken off. More than half (56%) of all patients surveyed have not used any online service [2].

Online Activity	Percent (%)
Ordering repeat prescriptions online	26%
Booking appointments online	19%
Had an online consultation or appointment	18%
Accessing my medical records online	7%
None of the above	56%
Key finding:
Patients with long term health conditions used online GP services 13% more than patients without long term conditions
Patients with a long-term condition were also more than twice as likely to order repeat prescriptions, 4% more likely to access their medical records online and 2% more likely to book appointments online [2].

Key finding:
Patients aged 75 and over are the least likely to use online GP services over all
The over 75s are 12% less likely to use online services than average, with more than two thirds (68%) having not using any online GP service in the last 12 months [2].

Interestingly, 16-24s were second least likely to use online GP services, with 41% using an online service in the last 12 months (compared with 44% nationally) [2].

Why aren't patients aged 75+ using online GP services?
In a recent report on digital inclusion, Age UK found that 42% of aged 75 and over do not use the internet [6].

Furthermore, a lack of digital skills among the over 75+ age group (79%) was the most common reason for not using the internet. The next most common reasons were a lack of trust in the internet (39%) and not having good enough access to equipment and/or broadband (30%) [6].

Ofcom's Digital Exclusion survey also found that 18% of digitally excluded adults aged 75 and over would be willing to go online to access health services [7].

Web Accessability
Key finding:
Patients are finding it more difficult to use their GP practice website, particularly for those aged 75 and over
A quarter (25%) of patients who used their GP practice's website found that it was 'not easy' to look for information or access services, compared with 22% in 2018. This increase was sharper for those aged 75 and over [2].

Furthermore, those patients with learning disabilities found it significantly more difficult (31% responded 'not easy') to look for information or access services on their GP website [2].

Conclusion
Patients have seen a fundamental shift in how general practices deliver primary care services. The GP Patient Survey has shown that patients are getting more familiar with online GP services such as remote appointments and ordering repeat prescriptions online.

And yet, some barriers remain: more than half of patients haven’t used any online GP service in the last 12 months, more patients felt in-person appointments met their needs, and GP practices websites need to be more accessible.

Moving forward, accessible, inclusive, and personalised healthcare services will be key to overcoming these barriers, building a solid foundation for further digital transformation.
